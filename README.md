### Data Structures and Algorithms using Ruby ###

This project contains some implementations of common data structures and algorithms in Ruby, along with RSpec tests for each.

So far, I have implemented these:

_Linked List_

_Binary Search_
I coded both recursive and non-recursive implementations, just to see how they compared from a performance view. There wasn't a dramatic difference, but the non-recursive implementation was about 15% faster. 

_Merge Sort_
